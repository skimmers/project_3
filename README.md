# Description

Once a user signs in, they will have access to a map page which will automatically populate with destination markers of EV charging stations located near them. When clicking on a marker, the user will be presented with information on the charging station. 

Within the same page, there is a search bar. When a location is entered in the searchbar, EV charging stations within that area will populate in the map.

Users will also have access to favorite their charging stations and their chosen stations will be posted to the "favorites" page.

# Goal

The goal of our site is to help people find EV charging stations more easily.

# Usage
To use this app, simply click to the url located in the deployment or the our application sections. Click sign up to make a new account. Once a new account is made, the user will be directed to the map page. 

On the map page, the user will be presented with EV charging stations near their location in the form of destination markers. The markers will present information on that location's charging station inside a popup when clicked on. 

In every popup, there will be the option to "favorite" a station by clicking on the star icon. Once the star is clicked, the favorited station will be posted on the "favorites" page. A user will also have the option to delete a favorited station.
