# ElectricAve

# Description

Once a user signs in, they will have access to a map page which will automatically populate with destination markers of EV charging stations located near them. When clicking on a marker, the user will be presented with information on the charging station. 

Within the same page, there is a search bar. When a location is entered in the searchbar, EV charging stations within that area will populate in the map.

Users will also have access to favorite their charging stations and their chosen stations will be posted to the "favorites" page.
